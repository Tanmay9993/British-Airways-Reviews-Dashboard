## 🎯 Business Problem & Purpose

Airline companies like British Airways receive **thousands of customer reviews**, but struggle to turn them into **clear, actionable insights**.

This dashboard answers questions such as:
- Are some aircraft types receiving consistently lower ratings?
- Which countries are the most/least satisfied with BA?
- What areas (seat comfort, food, entertainment) are underperforming?
- How has customer sentiment changed over time?
- Which traveler types are most dissatisfied?

### 👥 Target Users
- **Airline operations & strategy teams** → to identify service gaps and prioritize aircraft upgrades.
- **Marketing & customer experience teams** → to tailor messages and improvements by region or traveler type.
- **Customer support** → to investigate specific complaints over time or by aircraft.
- **Data-driven professionals** → interested in learning how review data can be visualized effectively.
